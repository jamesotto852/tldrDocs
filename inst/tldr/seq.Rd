\arguments{
  \item{from,to}{the start and end values of the sequence}
  \item{by}{increment of the sequence}
  \item{length.out}{desired length of the sequence
}
}

\details{
Generate a fine mesh between 0 and 1
\code{
seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)
}

Only need to specify one of by or length.out
\code{
seq(0, 10, by = 2)
seq(0, 10, length.out = 6)
}}
