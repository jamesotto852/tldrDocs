\title{The Distribution of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Statistic}
\arguments{
  \item{m,n}{number of observations in first and second sample
}
}

\details{
Compute the probability density at a point (x = 100)
\code{dwilcox(100, m = 10, n = 20)}

Compute the cumulative probability density up to a point (x = 100)
\code{pwilcox(100, m = 10, n = 20)}

Compute the 95th percentile
\code{qwilcox(.95, m = 10, n = 20)}

Generate draws (n = 10)
\code{rwilcox(10, m = 10, n = 20)}}
