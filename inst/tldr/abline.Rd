\arguments{
  \item{a,b}{intercept and intercept value(s) (or vector) for lines}
  \item{coef}{a two-element vector (intercept, slope) defining a line}
  \item{h,v}{y/x-value(s) for drawing horizontal/vertical line(s)}
  \item{reg}{a regression model or formula from which to extract coefficients}
  \item{...}{\{.help [graphical parameters](graphics::par)\}, e.g. `col`, `lty`, and`lwd`
}
}

\details{
Draw a line with a given intercept and slope:
\code{
plot(1:10)
abline(a = 2, b = 0.5)
abline(coef = c(2, 0.5), col = "red")
abline(a = 1:2, b = c(.5,.75), col = c("forestgreen", "red"))
}

Add horizontal and vertical lines:
\code{
plot(1:10)
abline(h = 5)
abline(v = 3, lty = 2)
}

Draw a regression line from a linear model:
\code{
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
abline(fit, lwd = 3)
}}
